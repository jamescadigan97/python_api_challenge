# Python Vacation analysis
In this assignment, I used an api from openweather.org to gather data from over 600 cities. In the first part (WeatherPY), I used python pandas to analyze the correlations between latititude and different weather attributes, including temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. In the second part (VactionPY), I used an api from Google to make a google heatmap of various temperatures from the different cities. I used pandas to narrow down possible vaction spots by places with ideal weather and used a google api to find hotels for each place I deemed a potiental vaction spot.
